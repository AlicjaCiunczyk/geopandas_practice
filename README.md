# geopandas
The intention of this project is to learn how to use a Python package geopandas (https://geopandas.org/). This package makes it easy to work with geospacial data, because it is based on pandas.
My intended goal for this project is to create a heatmap of Poland's Voivodeships according to their population.

The spatial data I used can be found at:
https://gis-support.pl/granice-administracyjne/ (file called Wojewodztwa).

The population numbers are for 2019 and were taken from Statistics Poland: https://stat.gov.pl/en/topics/population/population/area-and-population-in-the-territorial-profile-in-2019,4,13.html
