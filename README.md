# geopandas
The intention of this project is to learn how to use a Python package geopandas (https://geopandas.org/). This package makes it easy to work with geospacial data, because it is based on pandas.
My intended goal for this project is to create a heatmap of Poland's Voivodeships according to their population.

The spatial data I used can be found at:
